# Local development workflow

This repository uses a stable-mainline model. `main` is always deployable, and
product work happens in short-lived branches checked out in separate worktrees.
The primary checkout remains tied to the launchd-managed product so development
does not disturb the running local service.

## Starting work

1. Confirm the primary checkout is clean and either on `main` or on a release
   candidate pointing at the same commit:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/check_primary_checkout.py
   git status --short --branch
   git rev-parse main
   ```

   The primary checkout is the launchd-owned control and deployment checkout,
   not a scratch workspace. If the governance check fails, first move the WIP
   to an isolated task worktree (or otherwise preserve it explicitly); do not
   start another feature on top of it.

2. Create an isolated worktree and branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/workspace_governance.py create <type>/<slug>
   ```

   The branch must use `codex/{feat|fix|docs|chore|refactor|test|perf}/<slug>`.
   Keep it short-lived and push it to `myfork` before running long local
   verification or leaving significant work unattended.

3. Keep one product theme per branch. Classify work explicitly:

   - `feat`: new product capability or behavior.
   - `fix`: a defect in an already promised feature.
   - `test`: regression or real-device verification coverage.
   - `chore`: build, dependency, port, deployment, or release engineering.

Do not combine a feature, an unrelated bug fix, and broad cleanup in one branch.
Do not commit `.worktrees/`, build output, logs, local launchd configuration,
tokens, or cached credentials.
Keep rollback snapshots and deployment-recovery trees in ignored local paths
such as `backups/` or `web/.next-*/`; do not turn them into repository content.

## Workspace hygiene

Inspect the local fleet before and after significant work:

```bash
python3 scripts/workspace_governance.py audit --strict
```

The primary checkout must be clean, remain on `main`, and have no stash entries.
Prefer a commit on a topic branch over a stash whenever work must pause. If a
worktree contains experimental uncommitted work, snapshot it explicitly with
`workspace_governance.py archive`; do not treat stashes or dirty worktrees as
long-term storage.

Retire a worktree only after its branch is clean and present on `myfork`:

```bash
python3 scripts/workspace_governance.py retire /tmp/DeepTutor-<slug>
```

## Merging

Before merging a branch into `main`:

1. Rebase it on the latest `main`.
2. Keep the worktree clean.
3. Run the checks required for the touched subsystem.
4. Bind every new product behavior to at least one regression test.
5. Run `python3 scripts/check_primary_checkout.py` immediately before the
   fast-forward merge. It must pass; a dirty primary checkout means the WIP has
   not been protected or converged yet.

Merge only as a fast-forward from the primary checkout:

```bash
git switch main
git merge --ff-only codex/<slug>
git push myfork main
git worktree remove /tmp/DeepTutor-<slug>
git branch -d codex/<slug>
```

If the merge is not a fast-forward, return to the development worktree, rebase,
and rerun the focused checks. Do not hide divergence with an unplanned merge
commit, reset, or force push.

## Verification gates

Use the smallest relevant gate while developing, then the broader gate before
local product consolidation.

- Python changes: run focused `pytest` targets and Ruff on touched files.
- Web changes: run `cd web && npm run test:node` and `npm run lint`; require
  zero errors and no new warnings.
- Browser behavior: run the relevant Playwright suite.
- MarginNote 4: run its router, capability, and knowledge-base tests.
- Partner channels: run the Partner router, channel onboarding, and Feishu
  domain tests.

Before treating a revision as a local release candidate, also run the full
backend ledger from `LOCAL_FEATURES.md` and `npm run build`. Report every check
as pass, fail, or blocked; do not claim success for an unavailable check.

## Ports and product deployment

The product ports are fixed:

- Backend: `8001`
- Frontend: `3782`

The launchd services own those ports in the primary checkout. Development
worktrees must not write alternate ports into repository configuration or
`data/user/settings/system.json`. Pass temporary runtime ports explicitly with
environment variables, for example:

```bash
WEB_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4317
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:4318
```

After backend source changes reach the primary checkout, restart:

```bash
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.deeptutor.api
```

After frontend source changes reach the primary checkout, rebuild the
production standalone bundle, restart `com.deeptutor.web.3782`, and verify the
changed route returns 200 and contains the new code.

## Upstream contributions

Create small upstream PRs from `origin/main`, not from the local product
integration history. Keep these fork-local concerns out of upstream PRs unless
a maintainer explicitly asks for them:

- `LOCAL_FEATURES.md` and this workflow document.
- Partner QR onboarding.
- Local MarginNote 4 configuration or launchd setup.
- Temporary ports and local deployment details.


## Recovery

When a long-lived branch diverges:

1. Preserve it with an explicitly named branch.
2. Recreate the development branch from current `main`.
3. Rebase or cherry-pick only still-valid work.
4. Rerun the focused regression gate.

When `main` fails after consolidation, stop deployment, isolate the failure with
the relevant tests, and fix it through a `fix/...` branch. Do not use history
rewrites to make a broken release disappear.
