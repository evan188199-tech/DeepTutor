# Global Codex Engineering Delivery Rules

These rules apply by default to development in DeepTutor:

## Required Workflow

1. **Research**: read applicable documentation, relevant source and tests, and worktree status before coding.
2. **Decide**: identify product, architecture, security, compatibility, and migration constraints.
3. **Define acceptance**: publish a concise checklist of verifiable criteria before non-trivial coding.
4. **Develop**: implement in isolated task worktrees; never dirty the main control checkout.
5. **Test in reality**: run relevant pytest, typecheck, production build, and actual browser/runtime flow.
6. **Close the loop**: fix failures, rerun checks, report concrete `PASS` / `FAIL` / `BLOCKED` evidence.

## GitHub CLI in Sandboxed Environments

- Do not diagnose a GitHub CLI login as invalid from a sandboxed `gh auth status` failure alone. Restricted network access or credential-store access can produce a misleading invalid-token message.
- When GitHub access is needed, verify the actual login with an approved non-sandbox command: `gh api user --jq '.login'`.
- If that command succeeds, use the working `gh` identity for read/write GitHub actions instead of asking the user to re-authenticate.
- Only report a token/login problem after a non-sandbox GitHub API check fails with an authentication error.

## Workspace Governance

### Branch and Remote Model

| Branch | Allowed use | Update rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main` | Release mirror of upstream `HKUDS/DeepTutor` | Fast-forward only from `origin/main`; never local commits or edits |
| `dev` | Integration mirror of upstream `dev` | Fast-forward only from `origin/dev`; never local commits or edits |
| `multi-user` | Special integration branch | Base only for multi-user work that upstream routes there |
| `codex/feat/<slug>` | New user-visible capability | Create from `origin/dev`; rebase onto upstream `dev` |
| `codex/fix/<slug>` | Bug fix destined for upstream | Create from `origin/dev`; rebase onto upstream `dev` |
| `codex/{docs,chore,refactor,test,perf}/<slug>` | Scoped non-feature work | Create from `origin/dev`; rebase onto upstream `dev` |

On this machine, `origin` is the upstream repository (`HKUDS/DeepTutor`) and
`myfork` is the contribution fork. Never push task branches to `origin`; push
them to `myfork`, open a PR from the fork to upstream `dev`, and use SSH remotes
when available.

### Control and Task Worktrees

- **Control Checkout**: `/Users/Shared/DeepTutor` must remain clean and on `main` or `dev`. It receives no direct commits, no task branches, and no scratch edits.
- **Task Worktrees**: Create isolated worktrees with `python3 scripts/workspace_governance.py create feat/<name>` or `fix/<name>`. The tool creates `codex/<type>/<name>` from `origin/dev`.
- **Upstream Sync**: Run `python3 scripts/workspace_governance.py sync <worktree> --remote origin --base dev` in a clean worktree. It fetches upstream and rebases the task branch; `main` and `dev` use fast-forward only.
- **Contribution Back**: After tests pass, push the topic branch to `myfork`, open a PR to upstream `dev`, and keep the PR rebased rather than merging `dev` into the topic.
- **Archive-Before-Retire**: Worktrees are archived to `/Users/Shared/DeepTutor-worktree-archives/` before retirement via `python3 scripts/workspace_governance.py archive <path>`.
- **Safe Retirement**: Only retire worktrees whose PRs are merged/closed and whose local state is cleanly archived.

# DeepTutor — Agent-Native Architecture

## Overview

DeepTutor is an **agent-native** intelligent learning companion organized
around a two-layer plugin model — single-shot **Tools** invoked by the
LLM, and multi-stage **Capabilities** that take over a turn — exposed
through three entry points: CLI, WebSocket API, and Python SDK.

## Architecture

```
Entry Points:  CLI (Typer)  |  WebSocket /api/v1/ws  |  Python SDK
                    ↓                   ↓                   ↓
              ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │              ChatOrchestrator                    │
              │   routes UnifiedContext → selected Capability    │
              │   (defaults to `chat`)                           │
              └──────────┬──────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                         │              │
              ┌──────────▼──┐  ┌────────▼──────────┐
              │ ToolRegistry │  │ CapabilityRegistry │
              │  (Level 1)   │  │   (Level 2)        │
              └──────────────┘  └────────────────────┘
```

All capabilities emit on a shared `StreamBus`; the orchestrator fans
events out to consumers. Runtime settings live in
`data/user/settings/*.json` — project-root `.env` files are intentionally
ignored.

### Level 1 — Tools

Single-function tools the LLM picks on demand. Four user-toggleable tools
surface in `/settings/tools`:

| Tool           | Description                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `brainstorm`   | Breadth-first idea exploration with rationale |
| `web_search`   | Web search with citations                     |
| `paper_search` | arXiv preprint search                         |
| `reason`       | Dedicated deep-reasoning LLM call             |

The rest are **context-gated**: the chat capability auto-mounts them from
`ToolMountFlags` (presence of a KB, attachments, sandbox availability, …), and
any of them can also be force-enabled via `--tool`. Auto-mounted set: `rag`,
`read_source`, `read_memory`, `write_memory`, `read_skill`, `load_tools`,
`exec`, `code_execution` (sandboxed Python: NL intent → code → run),
`list_notebook`, `write_note`, `web_fetch`, `github`, `cron`,
`ask_user` (pauses the turn and resumes with the user's reply), plus the
mastery-path tools. `geogebra_analysis` is parked under
`COMING_SOON_TOOL_TYPES`.

### Level 2 — Capabilities

Multi-stage pipelines that own the turn:

| Capability       | Stages                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `chat`           | exploring → responding (single agentic loop, default) |
| `mastery_path`   | responding (Guided Learning — chat loop + mastery tools, gated per topic type) |
| `deep_solve`     | planning → reasoning → writing                        |
| `deep_question`  | ideation → generation                                 |
| `deep_research`  | rephrasing → decomposing → researching → reporting    |
| `visualize`      | analyzing → generating → reviewing (SVG / Chart.js / Mermaid / HTML; or routes to Manim sub-stages via `render_type`) |
| `math_animator`  | concept_analysis → concept_design → code_generation → code_retry → summary → render_output |

All capabilities converge on `emit_capability_result()` in
`deeptutor/capabilities/_shared.py` so every turn emits the same envelope
(response payload + `cost_summary` from `UsageTracker`). Status copy and
prompts are i18n'd via `capabilities/prompts/{en,zh}/<name>.yaml`.

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Install
pip install deeptutor      # Full app (CLI + Web/API + packaged Web assets)
pip install deeptutor-cli  # CLI-only

# Run any capability
deeptutor run chat "Explain Fourier transform"
deeptutor run deep_solve "Solve x^2=4" -t rag --kb my-kb
deeptutor run visualize "Animate sine wave" --config render_mode=manim_video

# Interactive REPL
deeptutor chat
# (inside the REPL: /regenerate or /retry re-runs the last user message)

# Partners (IM-connected companions)
deeptutor partner list

# Knowledge bases, memory, server
deeptutor kb list
deeptutor kb create my-kb --doc textbook.pdf
deeptutor memory show
deeptutor serve --port 8001       # API server only
deeptutor start                   # backend + frontend together
```

## Dependency Layers

Public install paths and source extras are defined in `pyproject.toml`.
Requirements files mirror the same dependency groups for Docker/CI installs.

```
pip install deeptutor      — Full app (CLI + Web/API + packaged Web assets)
pip install deeptutor-cli  — CLI-only (LLM + RAG + providers + document parsing)
pip install -e .           — Source install for development

Source extras (.[ extra ], defined in pyproject.toml):
.[cli]            — CLI-only dependency set
.[server]         — Web/API server dependencies
.[partners]       — Partner channel SDKs  (legacy alias: .[tutorbot])
.[matrix]         — Matrix channel for Partners (matrix-nio; needs libolm)
.[matrix-e2e]     — Matrix with end-to-end encryption (matrix-nio[e2e])
.[math-animator]  — Manim addon (powers `visualize` Manim renders + `deeptutor run math_animator`)
.[dev]            — Test / lint tooling
.[all]            — Everything above
```
